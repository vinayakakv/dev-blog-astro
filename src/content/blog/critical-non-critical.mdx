description: Are LLMs truly intelligent?
tldr: Go ask an LLM to summarize this article; why not?!

We are in AI boom now. If you start a company that has to do anything with AI (and has a shiny `.ai` domain), you are better poised to attract investor money. Apart from image and video generation models, today's AI world revolves around Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), hailing them to be the path towards Artificial General Intelligence.

LLMs are getting better day by day, thanks to their scale (GPT, Claude, LLaMa progrssion), innovative training methods and architectural tweaks (Deepseek, Diffusional LLMs). However, due to the nature of their complex architecture and non descriptive weights, [interpreting and tuning their behaviour]() remains a challenge, exposing [critical attack surfaces]() in AI Workflows powered by Model Context Protocol.

I was excited when OpenAI announced structured output and toolcalling support, as it was a way to expose LLMs to the external world and feed in the data. At work, we started using the LLM APIs to convert multimodal unstructured data to structured data. While this is working great today in production, this article notes down few nuances and open ends that one needs to aware of using LLMs for structral understanding of data.

## The Setup

We use Gemini models hosted on Google Cloud Platform to power our automation pipelines. Currently, our primary model is `gemini-2.0-flash-001`. We use Vercel's AI SDK (`npm i ai`!) to interface with these LLMs in our TypeScript codebase.

The problem in hand for the current discussion is extracting structured information from size labels found on the apparel websites. For example, in a pants website, a size of `31x32` means that the waist is _around_ 31 inch, and the inseam is _around_ 32 inch. Here is a basic prompt I came up with for the task:

Prompt:

```text
You are a fashion domain expert API.

You will be given a size label, size metadata and product context as an input in the json format

Your task is to break it down into components according to the provided schema. You should also combine them into a user friendly display size that contains all the information according to industry standards.

The display size should be small and informative, yet contain all of the information. Here are the instructions to derive display size:
- You can combine numerical info using x, and textual info using space. For example "30×32 regular"
- the order of the information matters. Follow industry standards here. For example waist will be before inseam, not the other way round
- extract all the relevant information from the size label and additional_info
- all of the components asked are numerical except for length

Examples:
- 30x32 in pants mean 30 is the waist, 32 is the inseam
- 14.5x20 in dress shirts mean 14.5 is the waist, 20 is the sleeve length

Here is your input:
```

The propmpt is very simple, with few examples. Below is the output schema the LLM is asked to produce JSON in. Note that the schema is quite verbose, containing a lot of optional strings.

JSON schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "chestComponent": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Chest measurement component — should be taken directly from the raw size string with minimal parsing or re-formatting."
    },
    "waistComponent": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Waist measurement component — extract as-is from the source size string; avoid heavy manipulation."
    },
    "inseamComponent": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Inseam measurement component — pull the value straight from the original size string, doing only lightweight trimming if necessary."
    },
    "neckComponent": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Neck measurement component — obtain this directly from the size string without elaborate processing."
    },
    "sleeveLengthComponent": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Sleeve-length measurement component — capture the value from the size string with minimal transformation."
    },
    "userFriendlySize": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Human-readable size label (e.g., “M”, “42R”, “Large”); this field is required."
    }
  },
  "required": ["userFriendlySize"]
}
```

To have a deterministic output every time, we set the parameters Top P and Temparature to 1 and 0 respectively for the sake of this discussion. In production, it is advised to have some non-determinism, as any output failing the checks can be retried and eventually pass the checks.

```json
{
  "model": "gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "topP": 1,
  "temparature": 0,
  "maxTokens": 300
}
```

## A test of _Intelligence_

Now, we will test the LLM by providing our input.

```json
{
  "size": "30×32",
  "context": "mens jeans pants",
  "additional_info": "bootcut"
}
```

While we expect it to be a nice JSON, BOOM! the model goes into infinite repitition loop!!

```json
{
  "userFriendlySize": "30x32 bootcut",
  "waistComponent": "30\", waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30x32. waist size in inches, mens jeans pants context, additional info bootcut size label 30
```
