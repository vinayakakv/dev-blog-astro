I was working with computers from an early age. My memory of drawing mountains in mspaint.exe in Windows 98 is still vivid. I remember my joy of successfully installing Windows XP, and, waiting for months to download 6GB Mac OS X Snow Leopard and build a Hackintosh ðŸ¤©.

I was introduced to programming with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and [LOGO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo*(programming_language)>) and found them to be enjoyable. My real application-oriented programming started on the Hackintosh with me writing C programs to verify my Math homework ðŸ˜…! Later on, I learned many programming languages, thanks to nice IDEs and code suggestion support! Nowadays, Iâ€™m comfortable with many programming languages, since they share common ideologies.

During my formal CS education at [SJCE](https://sjce.ac.in/) and [NITK](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), I was working on several projects ranging from Client-Sever Systems, P2P Systems, and Deep Learning. You can check some of them in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/vinayakakv)! Iâ€™m in software industry for sometime now and focus on all aspects of building software â€” including design, architecture, development, deployment and testing. Iâ€™m also comfortable with all verticals of the software stack.

Apart from programming, [I also hunt mountains, do photography and write about nature!](https://me.vinayakakv.com).
I also [blog](/blog) in this space, writing about the projects I've worked on, experience and learnings along the way.
